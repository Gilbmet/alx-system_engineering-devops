    1:25 PM: The team investigated the network infrastructure and database servers for any issues but found none.
    1:40 PM: Debugging and profiling tools were used to identify performance bottlenecks in the application code, but no significant issues were found.
    2:00 PM: The team escalated the incident to the database team and frontend team for further investigation.
    2:15 PM: The database team found a high number of slow queries in the database, leading to slow response times and increased load on the application servers.
    2:30 PM: The database team optimized the slow queries, which significantly improved database performance and resolved the issue.
    2:45 PM: The issue was fully resolved, and users were able to browse and purchase items without any delays or errors.

Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the issue was a high number of slow queries in the database, which resulted in increased response times and load on the application servers. The database team optimized the slow queries, which significantly improved database performance and resolved the issue.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To prevent similar issues in the future, the following measures will be taken:

    Implement a monitoring system to alert the team to slow database queries and other performance issues.
    Optimize database queries regularly to ensure fast response times and reduce load on the application servers.
