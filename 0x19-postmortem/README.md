Timeline:

    1:15 PM: The issue was first detected when the engineering team received multiple user complaints about slow page loading and error messages.
    1:20 PM: The monitoring system alerted the team to increased latency and errors on the application servers.
    1:25 PM: The team investigated the network infrastructure and database servers for any issues but found none.
    1:40 PM: Debugging and profiling tools were used to identify performance bottlenecks in the application code, but no significant issues were found.
    2:00 PM: The team escalated the incident to the database team and frontend team for further investigation.
    2:15 PM: The database team found a high number of slow queries in the database, leading to slow response times and increased load on the application servers.
    2:30 PM: The database team optimized the slow queries, which significantly improved database performance and resolved the issue.
    2:45 PM: The issue was fully resolved, and users were able to browse and purchase items without any delays or errors.

Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the issue was a high number of slow queries in the database, which resulted in increased response times and load on the application servers. The database team optimized the slow queries, which significantly improved database performance and resolved the issue.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To prevent similar issues in the future, the following measures will be taken:

    Implement a monitoring system to alert the team to slow database queries and other performance issues.
    Optimize database queries regularly to ensure fast response times and reduce load on the application servers.
    Increase capacity and redundancy of the database servers to handle high traffic and prevent outages.

In conclusion, the intermittent delays and errors experienced by our users were caused by slow database queries, which were resolved by optimizing the queries. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused our users and are taking measures to prevent similar issues in the future.
